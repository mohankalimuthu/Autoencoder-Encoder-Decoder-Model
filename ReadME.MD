# MNIST Digit Generation with Decoder

This project demonstrates how to use a standalone Decoder network to generate synthetic handwritten digits similar to the MNIST dataset. The model is built using PyTorch and utilizes a pre-trained state dictionary to reconstruct 28x28 grayscale images from random latent vectors.

## Description:
The primary goal of this notebook is to perform inference using a Decoder module. It loads a saved model (decoder.pth), maps random noise (latent space) through a series of linear layers and activation functions, and visualizes the resulting "fake" handwritten digits.

## Features
* **Standalone Decoder Inference:** Demonstrates image generation without needing an encoder at runtime.
* **Latent Space Sampling:** Uses Gaussian noise (**$z$**) to generate diverse digit representations.
* **Visualization:** Clear plotting of generated images in a grid format using Matplotlib.

## Project Structure

To replicate this project, your directory should contain the following:

* **Assignment_3.ipynb:** The main notebook containing the model definition and generation logic.

* **decoder.pth:** The pre-trained model weights (State Dictionary).

* **README.md:** Project documentation.

## Dataset
This project uses synthetic data generated by the model, which was originally trained on the MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset.

* **Image Size:** 28x28 pixels.

* **Format:** Grayscale (1 channel).

## How to Run
* **Environment:** Ensure you have a Python environment with torch, torchvision, and matplotlib installed.

* **Mount Drive:** If using Google Colab, mount your drive to access the .pth file.

* **Path Configuration:** Update the file path in torch.load() to match your local directory or cloud storage path.

* **Execute:** Run all cells in the notebook to define the class, load the weights, and generate the images.

## Sample Output
Upon successful execution, the model generates a $2 \times 5$ grid of grayscale images. These images represent synthetic versions of handwritten digits (0-9) generated entirely from random noise.
